                    <p>So! Who am I? I'm Tyler, a student at Texas A&M University. I love computer science and programming for good. I love free software and making useful things. I also love Vim, Linux, and other tools that improve my programming efficiency. I love learning new programming languages, but I consider myself language independent. </p>

                    <p>I believe I've picked up the skills to catch on to a new language quickly and apply my knowledge of programming concepts to any project or team. I've worked on some projects I'm proud of that you can find around this site. I've worked at some great places, and you can see more about that on my resume. I hope to make some more great projects and work at some more great places!</p>
