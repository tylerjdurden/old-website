description: Hacking for good.

---

In April, I was fortunate enough to travel to Dallas for HackDFW. There, I helped build a light therapy app that has me hooked on "Hacking for good."

HackDFW is a hackathon that takes place in Dallas, TX every year. Programmers, makers, creators, and enthusiasts of all kinds come together not to hack into other computers, but rather to "hack together" applications and devices for nearly any purpose. Some hackathons, like PennApps, are focused on health. Others are focused on space exploration. HackDFW was not focused on any issue in particular, but my team and I decided to make a medical hack.

One of my hackathon team members was a biomedical sciences major. She had recently read about light therapy, which is a new wave of treatment that is being heavily researched right now. We found several recently published studies describing the immense efficacy of light therapy for patients of Seasonal Affective Disorder, Depression, and even Alzheimer's. 

Our group was inspired! We believed that we could make an application to help patients receiving light therapy. We went around to various sponsors of the hackathon, who brought hardware and software to help hackers build more interesting projects by leveraging their products. ilumi is a company who makes smart bulbs. Featured on Shark Tank, ilumi is now a multi-million dollar company with their Bluetooth-controlled light bulbs being sold in big box stores. My team spoke with ilumi about the possibility of using their smart bulbs and software development kit (SDK) to create our project.

ilumi loved our idea! They gave us a bulb to work with and all the software they created for it. We instantly got to work on our Android application. As we developed the app, we also researched more about light therapy. As it turns out, light therapy is in clinical trials for affectations other than diseases. Light therapy is being used to help people get better sleep (using circadian rhythms). We built features for this (as well as insomnia) into our application as well.

We had a great time presenting our project to many different judges at HackDFW as well. After the first round of judging, ilumi announced on stage that our group was the winner of their sponsor prize, awarded for the team that best leveraged their technology! We were very excited for winning, but also incredibly excited about where the app could take us.

From here, I'm inspired to work further on medical hacks. I think that building projects to help those in need is a proper way of giving back to a community that has served me so well. The opportunities that I've had to attend hackathons as great as HackDFW is incredibly humbling. 

As I write this, I'm on the plane to Boston to attend HackMIT. I don't know what I'm building yet, but I hope it does some good.
