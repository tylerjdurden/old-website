fulldescription: I've finally finished my website! Well, not exactly. <br/><br/>This site will probably forever be in a mental beta. I won't update it as frequently as I should, but I wanted a place to show off the things I'm proud of. <br/><br/>So! Who am I? I'm Tyler, a student at Texas A&M University. I love computer science and programming for good. I love free software and making useful things. I also love Vim, Linux, and other tools that improve my programming efficiency. I love learning new programming languages, but I consider myself language independent. I believe I've picked up the skills to catch on to a new language quickly and apply my knowledge of programming concepts to any project or team. I've worked on some projects I'm proud of that you can find around this site. I've worked at some great places, and you can see more about that on my resume. I hope to make some more great projects and work at some more great places! <br/><br />Other than computer science-y things, I am passionate about music. I play a little guitar and drums, but my primary passion is audio technology and listening to music. I have a budget vinyl setup and I love making software for my music habit. I love hearing new and interesting music. <br/><br />With that said, drop me a line! Contact me! I have a contact form on this site too, and I don't want it to go to waste. Ask me anything, or recommend me some music! <br /><br />Thanks for stopping by!
